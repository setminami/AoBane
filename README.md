##What's This and What You Can...
This codes are extended from BlueFeather.<br>
The points of difference are
* You can use font TAG like this-> `*[blablabla](color|font faces#font size)`
  * *e.g.,* `*[blablabla](red|Times,Arial#5) -expand-> <font color="red" face="Times,Arial" size="5">blablabla</font>`
    - And I know that font TAG was duplicated in HTML5...
* You can use HTML special character by simple way.
